# Arduino2ArduinoSecureComm
At this project we developed Arduino to Arduino communication with AES-128 encryption. These 2 devices connected with wire and one of them im MasterSender and the other is SlaveReceiver.
This code not working properly. It can be send data wrong to wire or read from wire wrongly when you send too much data to the wire.
